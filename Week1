This week I spent time getting to know my peers and coaches and getting the set up done.

Once that was out of the way I started the course material. Working through a course on Git and the Command line was a great refresher on what I knew already. It also taught me some really important things that I didn't know - 

 -How to use the repl (irb)

 -How to run code from the terminal
 
I had a vague sense that I wasn't doing things in a 'proper coder' way but I'd never had guidance or consciously thought to look into a better way to do it, so having it introduced in week 1 with the expectation that that's how I'll code from here on in was awesome!
 
I moved onto the Ruby course, again it's so much better doing it the hard way - forking a repo and working on it, running the tests and reading the docs. I can see straight away why this makes you a more confident and competent engineer going forward. 
 
Practice makes the master. 

I've always been in a hurry to find the answer or solve the problem, but I think I need to slow down, read the docs, explore and play more. 

It's not about solving the problem it's about LEARNING!
