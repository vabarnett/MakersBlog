Wow - week 4 already! 

This week has been pretty tough- and today is only Wednesday! I spent the last two days doing the final challenges in the Golden Square phase 2 - designing a program of interconnecting classes and tests to match. I spent about 5 hours recording the final challenge and I wasn't sure if I was building my classes in the right way, but the program worked and my tests worked, so I guess it was at least a functioning solution!

I had an experience of pairing this week that felt quite uncomfortable, I found the communication difficult and I felt that my partner didn't really want to go back to where I was and re-visit the exercise. 

This morning we had a workshop on empathy and it gave me some new tools to reflect on the pairing exercise. I think some of the difficulty may have been a lack of empathy and a sense of difference between me and my partner. When I found communication difficult with them a feeling of difference lead me to feel that they might be judging me, which meant I found I was self-conscious and it was pretty uncomfortable. How could I improve on this next time? Perhaps look for common ground, ask their opinion on how they would like to proceed? Ask if they have found anything difficult recently? 

I've started the phase 3 units on mocking, it's a concept I'm aware of but have never used. I found the structure to use doubles rather counter-intuitive, but I'm sure that practice will help!
