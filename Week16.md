DevSecOps

I found there are some very useful and relevant youtube videos which approach the subject from the attackers point of view - this made the nebulous subject of security more concrete and gave me a starting point to work from. 

I feel that I have a better idea of what might constitute a security weak spot in theory but I am not confident that I would spot in in practice so easily.

The subject is vast and I feel I only have an impression of what I might need to know. 

Watching videos about the ingenious ways hackers can target software systems. Real life examples make the threat seem more real and relevant.

I'm still really tired, some of the week was interesting but some was frustrating and baffling.

The task was such that we didn't have a reference point to how much we should have been finding. In the end of unit workshop I realised how much my team had missed, not knowing what we didn't know it wasn't possible to see that we were a long way from thoroughly assessing the risks. If we'd realised how much we were missing we might have asked a coach for help.
