My role

I am a Junior Cloud Engineer, I will be part of a team that creates and maintains the infrastructure for the company's code  


My company, and what it does

I work for Compare the Market, perhaps the best-known and most-loved comparison site. We make making good financial decisions a breeze for everyone! 


Your team, as much as you (it's ok if you don't know anything, just put a header in and complete it when you know)

I work with the Cloud-Platform-Infrastructure team, I'm looking forward to meeting the new members who are starting soon and getting to know the existing ones better.

Your reasons for retraining as a DevOps engineer

Because I love learning and I'm fascinated by how things work, I came to Tech more or less by chance and it's been the best decision!
