This week we returned from the Christmas break ready to learn about Infrastructure as code (IaC) using a new tool - Terraform.

In previous weeks I have been increasingly frustrated working with the AWS console, trying to provision resources using 'point and click' methodoligy opens a wide door for mistakes and inconsistancies. Having seen IaC in place during my internship at Compare the Market it was great to finally have the chance to put this into practice! 

Terraform has lovely documentation, clear and well-structured as well as helpful examples of code. Working through the 8 stage tutorial was a pleasure, and I'll have no hesitation in revisiting it for a refresher when I need to. 

In a group we were given a trello board with tickets, broken down into fairly small chunks. 

One of our tickets required that a tech lead should be able to view the planned changes to infrastructure ahead of a Terraform apply. This took us down a little side ally, I found a useful resource on creating terraform artifacts (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/mr_integration.html) which I would like to re-visit. While I was reading about this, one of the team found a work-around method than generated and copied a plan.txt file to the S3 bucket we were using. 

It's a case in point that there are endless ways to acheive the same thing in tech!

We worked through a diagramming exercise, which was really useful and highlighted our differing concepts of what different commands actually did. Simo joined us for a mid-week check-in and helped clarify our thoughts and answered our questions too. 

We worked at a slower pace than other groups I've been in, but counter-intuitively this was really helpful as we took our time discussing and debating the work. For this reason I felt more confident in my learning and understanding, and despite not finishing all the tickets on Trello I feel that the groundwork I've laid for IaC is a solid one on which to build further knowledge.

All in all I feel it's been a really positive week and after the first three weeks of DevOps I can see what a benefit IaC brings!
