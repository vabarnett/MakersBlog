With the initial Ruby foundation lessons came the first set of drills and programming challenge. Completing the drills and testing after every one was a great way to get into the habit of continuous testing. At the end of the drills and challenge I realised that I hadn't been using git as I went along when I was asked for a github link. I hastily (and guiltily) made one big commit and pushed it. Lesson learned, make commits as I go along!
