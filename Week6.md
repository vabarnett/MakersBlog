Week 6 and we're learning about web apps! 

It's been an interesting week - the learning of the previous weeks is coming together, building layer upon layer to create a functioning program with greater capabilities. After getting to grips with the structures needed to utilise a postgres database this seemed fairly straightforward. 

Having used Django to create Python web-apps it was really interesting to re-visit web-apps in a new language and see the similarities and differences. Sinatra seems to have less in terms of pre-built structure, it feels more like a lightweight frame supporting the files to do their job. It was a good exercise in understanding what the different files are doing and how the routes work to send HTTP requests.  

I enjoyed experimenting with tools used to explore webpages as well as learning to build interactive features and logic in the HTML. Like many things in the Makers course, it has helped me to get a far better comprehension of things that I've experimented with previously.
