Group Project.

These two weeks were tough because we were working with a legacy codebase. We were handed a Node.JS/Express/MongoDB app and a trello board with tickets on it. I expected to find more in the code base that was familiar, but it really was very different to my previous experiences. 

We spent time familiarising ourselves with the codebase and then discussing how we would work together as a team. 

I found the team had a very different dynamic to previous teams I'd worked with, a large proportion of the team seemed reluctant to speak up in group settings. I find it difficul to sit in a meeting where everyone is quiet and so I found myself often driving conversation, trying to encourage others to contribute, as I knew in several cases their understanding of the material was better than mine. 

As the project progressed the team became more forthcoming with their communication and we explored some of the really cool tools used - I think we were all blown away by the ability to see videos of the failed tests in Cypress!

We found the work harder and slower than building from scratch, and it tested our ability to work as a team when faced with adversity. It made me really see the value of teamwork and communication as tools to effectively overcome problems.
