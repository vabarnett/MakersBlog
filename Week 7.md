In week 7 we tackled a group project - creating a B&B booking website in a team of 5. 

We built the project using Ruby and Sinatra with a PostgreSQL database. None of the tech itself was new to us, but we were learning how to plan a project and work as a team. 

We spent the first afternoon establishing work protocols, ensuring that everyone had the same expectations of how we would use tools like Git. We discussed how our team would approach branching and merging our work, which turned out to be a necessary step as not everyone had the same understanding of how branching would work. 

We discussed what our MVP would be, and after consulting with the coaches revised our MVP further to the narrowest verticle slice of the project possible. 

We practiced intentional over-communication (knowing that assumption is the mother of mistakes) and discovered on day two that we had not broken down our tickets enough and two pairs had ended up working on the same method. Issue resolved we moved forward making a concious effort to be clear in all the tickets exactly what they covered and what they did not. 

We changed work pairs daily and shared our knowledge in daily stand ups and check-ins. I felt that the team were all on the same wavelength and worked in really positive ways togther. I also really appreciated the chance to get to work with my new CtM colleagues Laura and Anna, as well as Tom and Danny who'll be going back to Google after the bootcamp. 

I really loved the group project, pulling together to create something was a great experience and I learned all sorts of little tips frmo my fellow bootcampers!
