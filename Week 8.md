Week 8 was an entirely new challenge - learning a new language. 

I was allocated to the JavaScript cohort and after a Monday morning kick-off started looking at the materials to begin working in a new language.

The first couple of days were really difficult, and I later realised this was in large part due to a lack of organisation of the learning materials. The upside of this was that it gave me an unplanned opportunity to find materials myself and really dig in to some self-directed learning. 

The makers materials introduced me to a test suite called Jasmine, while the syntax of tests was different the structure of the tests was very similar to RSpec and highlighted the underlying logic of unit testing. 

JavaScript itself takes a little getting used to, instead of getting in trouble for missing off the 'end' in ruby I find I'm getting in trouble for missing a semi-colon or not closing the various brackets in JS. I also found the terminology of JS confusing; having learned about objects in OOP, describing a specific data structure as an 'object' seemed unhelpful. But as Eddie pointed out, there are subtle differences between seemingly similar structures in different languges, and using the correct terminology not only makes communication between contributors clearer, but also helps us to remember that an object is not a hash (or a dict for that matter). 

By the end of the week I was using Jasmine to define and test a function before writing it and seeing some of the really cool stuff JS can do in making responsive changes to the front end. I really wished the week could have been longer as I was only just hitting my stride by Thursday, hopefully I'll have the chance to learn more and practice next week in the group project!
