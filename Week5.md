This week - databases - and I'm finally learning about Postgres!

Well, 4 days in and I am learning about Postgres but it's not simple by any means. I've found navigating the relationship between Ruby and a postgresql really tricky this week. I understand the way that tables relate to each other with the one-to-one and one-to-many relationships etc. But I have found writing the code in ruby that talks to the database very difficult indeed. 

There are a lot of connecting pieces, including files for database connection and files to create objects and files to run SQL commands and files to test, and I have only a very hazy mental picture of how they come together and work. I have found the video demonstrations harder to follow too. Hopefully as I continue to work through the exercises things will become clearer. 

I did try diagramming the system but found that more confusing than elucidating.
