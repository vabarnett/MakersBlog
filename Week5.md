This week - databases - and I'm finally learning about Postgres!

    *****************************************************

Well, 4 days in and I am learning about Postgres but it's not simple by any means. I've found navigating the relationship between Ruby and a postgresql really tricky this week. I understand the way that tables relate to each other with the one-to-one and one-to-many relationships etc. But I have found writing the code in ruby that talks to the database very difficult indeed. 

There are a lot of connecting pieces, including files for database connection and files to create objects and files to run SQL commands and files to test, and I have only a very hazy mental picture of how they come together and work. I have found the video demonstrations harder to follow too. Hopefully as I continue to work through the exercises things will become clearer. 

I did try diagramming the system but found that more confusing than elucidating.

    Well at the end of the week I hadn't finished the whole of the database module, but I have done all the challenges judged to be essential before moving on. 
    
    I finally reached a point of understanding with the creation of the ruby/database integration. Repeatedly creating ruby/postgres structures and navigating them in the challenges was really tough, but it helped me to reach an understanding built on exploration and creation. I'm sure I have plenty to learn when it comes to implementing them in real life but I'm really pleased to have reached a breakthrough moment!
