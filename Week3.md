Week three and into the Golden Square module. 

The module teaches and reinforces four principles of software engineering:

 - Debugging
 - Testing
 - Object-oriented design
 - Pair programming

Working through a cycle of teaching and practice modules (alone and in a pair) establishes a strong procedural approach to breaking down and solving problems.

I enjoyed my first pairing experiences and I recorded a challenge with Deborah this week. I thought we did a great job and was surprised to open a lengthy feedback message from Will the coach. It turns out we had approached the problem from the wrong perspective, I was focussed on solving the coding challenge and hadn't stopped to think about what it was meant to be teaching us. Will pointed out (very kindly) that the challenge was there for us to practice solving a problem methodically using testing and an established process.

Lesson learned. I went to the next exercise and spent more time watching the video guidance, slowing down, writing examples and tests and then translating these into the code product. I used 'xit' to skip tests until I wanted to run them against the code and it made the process much easier in terms of reading the terminal output from the tests. 

Having digested the idea that examples and good tests lead to better code, I found myself seeing more value in the process and, instead of feeling impatient with the process, I actually enjoyed writing the tests and running them.
