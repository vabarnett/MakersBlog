First week of project:

This week we started the final project of the bootcamp. I was really pleased with the group I was put into which was made up of people with different strengths and great soft skills! 

Out project was to improve the reliability of service without having access to the server or UI! All we had was access to the loadbalancer and at first I didn't see how it would be possible to improve the reliability rate. 

We initially put measures in place to get a better idea of what was happening. We enabled logging and created an S3 bucket to store the logs. We used Athena to view logs and found a lot of traffic coming from the web (rather than the traffic generator that was simulating genuine requests from the vetinary hospital). Some of these requests appeared to be malicious as they were requesting admin and sitemapping routes. Given the nature of the system (with known legitimate sources of traffic) we used a security group setting to limit incoming traffic to a single ip address. 

Once the source-limiting was done we could see more clearly what errors were present and these were mostly status 500s - internal server error. There seemed to be no particular pattern to the requests that were failing, the same url would sometimes be successful and other times would fail. So if the route was fine it had to be inconsistency of the server rather than the code. 

We figured that to improve reliability we needed to retry the requests that were returning 500 errors, if a route failed once it might be successful a second or third time, so we started to explore this.

We spent time looking at options for retrying failed requests and went down some blind allies - I learned that http requests must be handled synchronously and therefore SQS (queue systems) are not suitable as they create latency that would cause the http request to fail anyway. 

In the end our team created a new EC2 instance with nginx running on it. We used this as a reverse proxy sitting between the load-balancer and the server to intercept 500 and 502 responses. We had to try several times to get the correct configuration to retry the requests successfully, but once we did the failure rate dropped below 1%, giving us the target reliability of 99%.

Second week:

In the second week we looked at improving security. Having added a new resource we needed to make sure that traffic into the reverse proxy was limited to legitimate traffic. We knew this would be someting we could acheive using security groups on the EC2 but rather than making changes to the one currently in operation we decided to create a new EC2 using IAC principles. 

We created a gitlab CICD pipeline which triggered a terraform file to provision a new EC2 instance. The new EC2 used security groups that would limit the incoming traffic to only that with the ip address of the traffic generator. In a real-world situation it could be limited to a list of known and trusted ip addresses. 

Once the pipline had been run and the instance was generated we used the load balancer to divert a small proportion of traffice from the original reverse proxy to the new, more secure, one. Keeping a close eye on the metrics we realised as we increased traffic that the new reverse proxy wasn't functioning correctly. It transpired that our EC2 had some health issues which was causing a failure in the system. 

We immediately rerouted all traffic back to the original EC2 so that reliability was maintained, giving us time to inspect and correct the faulty instance. 

I really enjoyed working on this project, and the main reason was because our team worked so well together. There was a noticable lack of ego and I think I'm right in saying that everyone was able to contribute throughout the project. Our communication was very strong and in cases where someone didn't understand something, we spent time as a group discussing and diagramming until we were all on the same page. Incidentally, this also helped to uncover where we had made assumptions and allowed us to discuss them and proceed with everyone on the same page.
